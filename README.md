These are shell scripts I use regularly.
#### compiler
this is a clone of Luke Smith's compiler script included
in larbs.xyz. I use it in vim to compile lots of things.
Mostly lilypond documents and groff documents.
#### lilypond-build
this script is specially designed for the way
a structure lilypond projects. it allows me to quickly
edit large documents from any of its constituent pieces
and allows me to avoid using pesky \\include commands
in lilypond files.
